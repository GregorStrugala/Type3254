Type 3254
=========

This Type has two main purposes: estimating the performances from the
environmental conditions and the compressor frequency,
and to deterÂ­mine the supply air state.
The capacity output can be controlled through the frequency input.
Moreover, the Type 3254 is able to operate in heating and cooling mode,
and to simulate defrost cycles.
For more details, have a look at the in-depth features section.
