Model variable capacity air-to-air heat pumps in TRNSYS
===========================================================

The TRNSYS Types 3254 and 3223 presented here aim to model single zone,
mini-split air-to-air heat pumps equipped with a variable speed comp­ressor.
The Type 3254 relies on performance maps to model performance, and the Type 3223
is dedicated to control aspects (see fig. 1).
As of this version, the model is exclusively dedicated to short time step
simulations—ideally below 5 minutes.
